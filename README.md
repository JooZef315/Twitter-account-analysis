### udacity data analyst nanodegree project

Real-world data rarely comes clean. 
Using Python and its libraries, i gatherwed data from a variety of sources and in a variety of formats, 
assessed its quality and tidiness, then cleaned it. i documented my wrangling efforts in a Jupyter Notebook,
plus showcase them through analyses and visualizations using Python.
The dataset that i wrangled (and analyzied and visualized) is the tweet archive of Twitter user @dog_rates, also known as WeRateDogs.

I used :pandas, NumPy,requests, tweepy, json
